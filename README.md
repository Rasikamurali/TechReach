As a first year student in an Engineering college, I was intrigued by the scope of science and technology in this world, but I realized that in my shorts years as a STEM student I had no idea about the various domains of technology and didn't truly understand what engineering was either. Many people enter the field of technology with the idea that it will create a steady source of income and though it is true, most people fail to see the beauty that lies within it. My aim is to create an app that will unveil various spheres of science and technology to show the vastness of it. The app will be targeted at high-school to college students as it will give them an understanding of the opportunities that are available and how to get started with them. I intend to use my skills as a beginner level android developer and creativity to make this idea into reality.
